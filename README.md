Global COVID-19 Analysis (SQL)
Project Description
This SQL project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using comprehensive datasets from Worldometer. The analysis includes infection rates, recovery trends, and vaccination progress to provide insights into COVID-19 impacts across regions and over time. This project showcases SQL competencies in data handling, processing, and analyzing large datasets for public health insights.

Data Overview
Datasets
worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data: Contains summary COVID-19 data by country and region, including cumulative cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
worldometer_coronavirus_daily_data: Contains daily updates on infection and vaccination numbers for individual countries, enabling time-series analysis.
Objective
The goal is to derive key public health insights, tracking COVID-19â€™s impact and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. This project demonstrates proficiency in managing, processing, and analyzing large-scale data in SQL.

Data Pipeline Summary
Data Acquisition: Load datasets into SQL for processing.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Ensure data consistency, remove duplicates, standardize data types, and handle missing values.
Data Storage: Store cleaned data in SQL tables (worldometer_summary and worldometer_daily).
Data Analysis:
Track infection trends, fatality and recovery rates, and vaccination progress over time and by region.
Use joins to perform comparative analysis across tables.
Data Export: Export significant insights or aggregated data for reporting or visualization.
SQL Queries and Analytical Approach
Trend Analysis: Queries calculating weekly and monthly infection trends by region.
Vaccination Analysis: Queries analyzing the rate of vaccination rollout and its impact on infection rates.
Comparative Analysis: Combine daily and summary data to observe day-to-day variations relative to overall progress.
Setup and Usage
Database Setup:
Create a database named COVID19_Global_Analysis in SQL Server.
Import the datasets as tables (worldometer_summary and worldometer_daily).
Running Queries:
Sample SQL scripts are available in the /queries folder, providing starting points for trend, vaccination, and comparative analysis.
Customize scripts to focus on specific regions or timeframes.
Dependencies: SQL Server or a compatible SQL environment is required to execute the analysis queries.
