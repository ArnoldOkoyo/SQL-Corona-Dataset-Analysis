# Global COVID-19 Analysis (SQL)

## Project Description
This SQL project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using comprehensive datasets from Worldometer. The analysis includes infection rates, recovery trends, and vaccination progress to provide insights into COVID-19 impacts across regions and over time. This project showcases SQL competencies in data handling, processing, and analyzing large datasets for public health insights.

## Data Overview

### Datasets
- **worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data**: Contains summary COVID-19 data by country and region, including cumulative cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
- **worldometer_coronavirus_daily_data**: Contains daily updates on infection and vaccination numbers for individual countries, enabling time-series analysis.

## Objective
The goal is to derive key public health insights, tracking COVID-19â€™s impact and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. This project demonstrates proficiency in managing, processing, and analyzing large-scale data in SQL.

## Data Pipeline Summary
1. **Data Acquisition**: Load datasets into SQL for processing.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Ensure data consistency, remove duplicates, standardize data types, and handle missing values.
3. **Data Storage**: Store cleaned data in SQL tables (`worldometer_summary` and `worldometer_daily`).
4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Track infection trends, fatality and recovery rates, and vaccination progress over time and by region.
   - Use joins to perform comparative analysis across tables.
5. **Data Export**: Export significant insights or aggregated data for reporting or visualization.

## SQL Queries and Analytical Approach
- **Trend Analysis**: Queries calculating weekly and monthly infection trends by region.
- **Vaccination Analysis**: Queries analyzing the rate of vaccination rollout and its impact on infection rates.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Combine daily and summary data to observe day-to-day variations relative to overall progress.

## Setup and Usage

### Database Setup:
1. Create a database named `COVID19_Global_Analysis` in SQL Server.
2. Import the datasets as tables (`worldometer_summary` and `worldometer_daily`).

### Running Queries:
Sample SQL scripts are available in the `/queries` folder, providing starting points for trend, vaccination, and comparative analysis. Customize scripts to focus on specific regions or timeframes.

### Dependencies:
SQL Server or a compatible SQL environment is required to execute the analysis queries.
